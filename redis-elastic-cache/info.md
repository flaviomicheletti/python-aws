# Info about the Redis ElastiCache

The boto3 library is used for programmatically managing AWS infrastructure 
resources, e.g. creating an ElastiCache cluster, tagging an existing cluster, 
modifying security groups etc. 

It is not a general-purpose Redis SDK. You can use a Python package such as 
redis for that
